      <u><h2>Autonomous Dynamometer for Lab Testing Environment</h2></u>
      <img src="test.png" />
      The goal of this project was to design an autonomous dynamometer for a lab
      testing environment. The purpose of this design was to significantly
      reduce the manual labour and lead time required to generate a torque-speed
      curve.

      To identify potential solutions and define the functional requirements, it
      was necessary to conduct an extensive literature review alongside a system
      breakdown. The following section details the findings of this prelimanary
      R&D phase.
      <div class="post" id="post2"></div>
      <h2><u>System Breakdown</u></h2>
      As can be seen in the figure below, a system breakdown yielded three
      subsystems of interest. Note that dashed lines represent a data transfer
      while solid lines represent an energy transfer.
      <img src="NewSysB.jpg" height="400" />
      <div id="MechSystems"></div>
      <font size="+2"><u>Mechanical Systems</u></font
      ><br />
      At it's core, the mechanical system is centered around the use of a prony
      brake; a pre-existing design used for relating speed & torque on a given
      motor. As the wooden blocks are tightened against the flywheel, it slows
      down and induces a reactionary torque upon the moment arm.
      <img src="prony.jpeg" width="795" id="testest" />
      Stepper motors were used to tighten the wooden blocks against the
      flywheel. To convert the rotation of a given stepper motor into a linear
      motion of the brake pads, the two motors were equipped with lead screws
      and threaded bolts.
      <img src="leadScrew.gif" />
      <br /><br />
      <div id="MeasSystems"></div>
      <font size="+2"><u>Measurement systems</u></font
      ><br />
      For the purposes of this design, the following measurements were of
      interest: <br />
      <font size="-1">
        (1) Motor Output: RPM <br />
        (2) Motor Output: Torque <br />
        (3) Motor Input: Voltage <br />
        (4) Motor Input: Current <br /> </font
      ><br />
      Note that the inclusion of parameters (3) and (4) will allow operators to
      make efficiency measurements.<br />
      <font size="-1">
        Input Power = Voltage * Current <br />
        Output Power = Torque * Speed <br />
        %Efficiency = (Output Power/Input Power) <br />
      </font>
      <br /><br />
      <u><b>[1]Motor Output: Speed/RPM</b></u
      ><br />
      The most practical way to measure shaft speed was to use a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_sensor" target="_blank"
        >hall effect sensor</a
      >. It operates on the principle that as a magnet approaches the sensor,
      it's output voltage will rise. By attaching a magnet to the flywheel and
      polling the sensor for a positive rise, the hall effect sensor has
      effectively become a Tachometer.
      <img src="Hall_sensor_tach.gif" />
      <small
        ><u>Note:</u> For the following implementation to work, the polling
        rates of both the sensor and microcontroller must greater than twice the
        motors maximum frequency. See
        <a

      >
      <br /><br />
      <u>[2]Motor Output: Torque</u><br />
      To measure the motor's output torque, a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Load_cell" target="_blank"
        >load cell</a
      >
      was placaced underneath the prony brake's moment arm. Load cells provide
      measurements of point force <i>"F"</i> in terms of an output voltage
      <i>"V<sub>out</sub>"</i>.<br />
      <a href="#testest" target="_blank">As shown in this image</a>, by
      attaching the load cell to the end of the moment arm, measurements of the
      aforementioned point force <i>"F"</i> can be converted to torque
      <i>"T"</i> via multiplication of arm length <i>"L"</i>. The load cell used
      for this application would be an FSR402 paired with a resistor of 3,000
      ohms. <br />
      As is the case for all load cells, it was necessary to perform a static
      calibration process.
      <img src="FSR.png" />
      <br /><br />
      <u>[3]Motor Input: Voltage</u><br />
      To measure voltage across the motor is a relatively simply task, however
      many motors operate at a voltages that exceed the operational range of an
      Arduino's Analog-Digital-Converter (5V). For this reason, a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider" target="_blank"
        >voltage dividing circuit</a
      >
      was constructed in parallel to the motor.
      <img src="volDiv.jpeg" />
      Using two analog inputs, a microcontroller could measure the difference
      between the two nodes of R<sub>2</sub>, and calculate the voltage across
      the motor.
      <br /><br />
      <u>[4]Motor Input: Current</u><br />
      To measure the current being drawn by the motor, a DIY ammeter was
      constructed.<br />
      In a process similar to that of the voltmeter, the DAC would sample
      voltage readings across a known resistor and calculate the difference
      between them. Once the potential difference is known,
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohm%27s_law" target="_blank"
        >Ohm’s Law</a
      >
      would be applied to solve for current.
      <img src="ohms.png" height="200" /><br />
      <br /><br />
      <div id="ContSystems"></div>
      <font size="+2"><u>Control Systems</u></font
      ><br />
      After careful consideration of the problem statement and system
      requirements, it was determined that a closed-loop control system would
      not be necessary if the systems braking torque were applied by a stepper
      motor. This is due to a unique characteristic of stepper motors in that
      the motor's position can be commanded to move and hold at discrete
      intervals without any position sensor for feedback (an open-loop
      controller). The following open-loop control systems would be implemented.
      <ul>
        <li>Manually Increment Stepper Motors</li>
        <li>Manually Decrement Stepper Motors</li>
        <li>Initiate Autonomous Motor Test from Stall Torque(0 RPM)</li>
        <li>Initiate Autonomous Motor Test from No-Load Speed (0 Torque)</li>
        <li>On/Off</li>
      </ul>
      The user interface for triggering these commands will take the form of
      simple buttons, handled by an arduino.
      <div class="post" id="post3"></div>
      <h2><u>Implementation</u></h2>
      The circuit diagram shown below displays the wiring configuration of the
      final cicruit. It will be referred to numerous times in the following
      section. Black cables lead to circuit ground (0V) while red cables carry
      voltage from a source.<img src="codeSetup.png" class="image" />
      <img src="circuitDiagram.png" />
      <img src="codeMainLoop.png" class="image" />

      <br /><br />
      <div id="Tach"></div>
      <u>[1]Motor Output: Speed/RPM</u><br />
      The tachometer makes use of a 3-pin Hall Effect Sensor. The positive and
      negative nodes are connected to 5V Power and 0V ground respectively. The
      the output pin is wired directly to the Arduino's digital input buss via
      pin 2 (orange wire).
      <img src="codeHall.png" />
      Upon calling the <i>"Tachometer()"</i> function, the Arduino will be
      handled by an
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_handler" target="_blank"
        >interrupt</a
      >
      named <i>"Counter()”</i>, triggered by a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_edge" target="_blank"
        >rising edge</a
      >
      from the Hall Effect Sensor. The purpose of this interrupt is to count
      rotations of the flywheel over a given time interval, effectively
      measuring the RPM of the testing motor. The amount of rotations used to
      calculate RPM is a tweakable tuning parameter <i>hallThreshold</i>.
      <br /><br />
      <div id="Torque"></div>
      <u>[2]Motor Output: Torque</u><br />
      Torque measurements are gathered via analog input pin 0 (blue wire),
      between the negative node of the
      <a

        >FSR</a
      >
      and the postivie node of the 3,000 ohm resistor. For a sensor of this
      type, it was necessary to perform a static calibration process such that
      the measured voltage could be converted into a meaninful and accurate
      measurement of force. The calibrated system was modelled as a

        has a sampling resolution of 10 bits. This means that there are 2<sup

        (1024) possible input values corresponding to the range between 0 and 5
        volts. This integer input is manually converted into
        <i>"FSRVoltage"</i>, a floating point value between of 0 and 5.</small

      <div id="Voltmeter"></div>
      <u>[3]Motor Input: Voltage</u><br />
      Using two analog inputs (pins 3 and 4, green wires), the voltmeter
      implemented makes use of simple ohm’s law to quickly return the voltage
      across a given testing motor. Should future testing requirements call for
      alternative scaling of voltage division, the values of the two resistors
      have been provided as tweakable tuning parameters <i>vResistor1</i> and
      <i>vResistor2</i>.
      <img src="codeVolt.png" />
      <small
        ><u>Note:</u> As mentioned above, the Aanalog-Digital-Coversion has a
        resolution of 2<sup>10</sup> (0&rarr;1023), and must be converted to a
        floating point between 0 and 5 volts.</small

      <br /><br />
      <div id="Ammeter"></div>
      <u>[4]Motor Input: Current</u><br />
      In a process similar to that of the voltmeter, the DAC samples voltage
      readings across a known resistor and calculate the difference between
      them. Once the potential difference is known, Ohm’s law is applied to
      solve for current.
      <img src="codeAmm.png" />
      Should future designs and testing requirements call for a more or less
      sensitive ammeter, the value of the resistor has been provided as a
      tweakable tuning parameter.
      <br /><br />
      <div id="CSystem"></div>
      <u>Control System</u><br />
      As mentioned above, the use of stepper motors offers the lucrative
      opportunity to simplify & cheapen this design through the implementation
      of an<br />
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-loop_controller">open-loop</a>
      control system as opposed to one that is
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed-loop_controller">closed</a
      >.<br />
      This figure below shows the highest branch in the program code, the main
      loop. This loop serves only to scan for user input. From here, the system
      may be primed into one of two possible testing conditions. By adjusting
      the clamping force applied to the motor, testing may be initiated from
      either stall torque or no torque.

      <h2><u>Conclusion</u></h2>
      The purpose of the design was to automate an existing Dynamometer setup by
      integrating an Arduino microcontroller, electronic sensors, and a central
      control system. The design successfully met its objective. The range of
      motors that the design can test is constrained by multiple parameters;
      namely the maximum stall torque the design could handle.
      <br />
      A possible progression would be to innovate this design to cater to a
      larger range of motors; most notably, induction motors. <br />
